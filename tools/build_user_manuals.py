chapter('Sampling: choose an input and record',['SAMPLING'],
 'Sampling records a waveform into the selected Sound. Choose the target pad while the Record page remains open. The stereo meters show the incoming level and the Detect threshold marker.',
 steps=['Press SAMPLING and choose RECORD. Select EXT MONO, EXT STEREO or INTERNAL. Choose an available input channel/pair, or the internal source you want to resample.',
 'Play the source and inspect the meters. Adjust the source gain and, on supported HAT hardware, Input Gain. Leave headroom; a clipped recording cannot be repaired by normalizing it.',
 'Select DETECT to arm a threshold-triggered recording, or SYNC for transport/grid-related capture. Set threshold or length/synchronization options before arming.',
 'Use the displayed START/REC action. In DETECT, recording waits for the signal to cross the threshold; the manual trigger action can start it while armed. STOP finishes the take and CANCEL abandons it.',
 'Play the target pad to check the recording. Recorded files use simple numbered Sample names. Use the available history actions to return to an earlier take.'],

The page arrows switch playback-range and selection banks. Encoders 3 and 4 remain ZOOM and SCROLL.'),
 'Choose a processing action with the labelled previous/next actions. NORMALIZE raises the sample level; other operations act on the selected audio according to their settings. Confirm APPLY only after checking the range.',
 'For STRETCH, set its tempo/length options and audition before APPLY. CANCEL returns without committing the preview.'],
 notes=[('Normalize and slices','Normalize the source sample when you want all slices to inherit the change. A slice is a range of that source, not a separate normalization target. Zone gain is a different playback parameter.'),
 ('Original audio','Processing creates derived audio rather than silently overwriting the source file. SAVE AS and COLLECT SAMPLES are still recommended before restructuring an important project.'),
 ('Deleting','Clearing a Sound slot removes the Sound assignment. It is different from deleting a recording/file. Use the explicit sample-delete view and confirmation for file deletion.')])

chapter('Zoom and scroll the waveform',['SAMPLE EDIT','CHOP'],
 'Zoom changes the amount of audio visible, not the playback speed or sample length. Scroll moves the visible window. The edited range and its markers remain part of the waveform.',

 notes=[('Two different kinds of effect','The Sampler filter is built in at Sound level. An LV2 filter is a separate chain plug-in and may also process a Group or Master. Deliberate SR/BITS reduction produces a bitcrusher effect; it is not a recording-rate setting.')])

chapter('LV2 plug-ins: add, replace and remove',['PLUGIN BROWSE','PLUGIN'],
 'Each Sound, Group and Master has its own plug-in chain. Compatible LV2 effects can process audio; an instrument belongs at the first instrument position of a Sound chain.',
 steps=['Choose the intended MASTER, GROUP or SOUND scope. Open PLUG-IN navigation and select an existing slot or ADD PLUGIN.',
 'Use SHIFT + BROWSE to open the plug-in browser even when a slot is already occupied. Select an effect/instrument from the compatible catalog and load it into the chosen position.',
 'Turn the shown controls and play the pads to audition. Page through additional parameters. BYPASS lets you compare processed and unprocessed audio.',
 either('Select the slot with NAV + arrows. In plug-in navigation/slot editing use REMOVE, or SHIFT + BROWSE and select the remove entry. Confirm REMOVE PLUGIN?.','Hold SHIFT in the plug-in view for chain actions. Display button 6 opens BROWSE and 7 is REMOVE; confirm the removal. COPY/PASTE/MOVE are shown on the left.')],
 notes=[('Chain management','COPY/PASTE duplicate the selected plug-in state; MOVE reorders it. An instrument must remain first. Removing/reordering also updates associated parameter references, so save a copy before restructuring a complex automated chain.'),
 ('Real-time budget','Plug-ins differ widely in processing cost and reported latency. Test each chain at the desired buffer. A tape or look-ahead effect can add audible delay even when pads and displays respond immediately.')])

chapter('Channel routing and the Mixer',['CHANNEL','MIXER'],
 'Channel properties describe where a Sound or Group receives and sends audio. The Mixer presents levels, pan and routes together. Direct hardware destinations depend on the selected interface.',
 steps=['Choose SOUND, GROUP or MASTER. Open CHANNEL and select OUTPUT. Use AUDIO for the main destination, AUX1/AUX2 for sends and, at Sound scope, MIDI for external-note output.',
 'To use separate interface outputs, select the output port/pair offered by the interface. Route the selected Sound or Group and verify the destination on the interface itself.',
 either('Open Mixer with SHIFT + VIEW. F1/F2/F3 choose Master/Group/Sound. Navigate to the desired channel and choose its level, pan or output field.','Hold NAVIGATE and choose MIXER. Display buttons 1-3 choose scope; 5-7 choose LEVEL, PAN or ROUTE. The vertical strips align with the parameter encoders.'),
 'Set Main Output and a separate Cue Output in Audio settings. Use Cue Level for audition level. Main and Cue may not overlap the same hardware channels.'],
 notes=[('Input and feedback','INPUT selects external/internal channel sources and monitoring-related properties. Avoid routing a destination back into its own input; invalid routing cycles are rejected.'),
 ('Musical level versus interface level','Master level adjusts the project mix. The ULTRA HAT headphone/speaker controls change codec output level and Input Gain changes capture gain. Hardware-specific controls are not universal USB-interface gain knobs.')])

chapter('Mute, solo, selection and duplication',['MUTE','SELECT'],
 'Focus chooses what you edit. Multi-selection chooses a set of targets. Mute/solo changes what can be heard. These states are independent and remain visible through their mode views and LEDs.',
 steps=['Hold MUTE or SOLO and press the relevant Sound pad to toggle its state. Group-level actions affect the selected Group; on MK2 the dedicated Group keys operate Group mute/solo in those views.',
 'Muting silences the running sample immediately rather than waiting for the tail to finish. If an entire Group is silent, inspect Group mute and Scene clip activation as well as Sound mute.',
 'Use SELECT for quiet focus and multi-selection. Choose ALL/NONE where available. On MK2, ALL toggles between all sixteen Sounds and the focused Sound; in the event grid it toggles event selection.',
 'Use DUPLICATE with the appropriate source and destination selection. Check whether you are duplicating a Sound, a Pattern or a Scene before confirming the operation.'],
 notes=[('Global stop for voices','SHIFT + MUTE chokes all active sample voices, plug-in/MIDI notes, previews and held repeat/arp notes from any screen. It does not switch your edit workspace.'),
 ('Clear is not Sound reset','SHIFT + CLEAR removes targeted Pattern notes. To empty a Sound slot, hold SHIFT + ERASE and press its pad. This clears its sample/plug-in assignment; it is a different operation from muting it.')])

chapter('Scenes and Song arrangement',['SCENE','SONG'],
 'A Scene recalls one Pattern reference per Group. Song is an ordered list of Scenes. Repeating a Scene repeats those references; editing a shared Pattern changes every place that uses it.',
 steps=['Create Patterns in the relevant Groups. Select a Scene, then choose each Group Pattern that belongs in that Scene. Leave a clip empty when the Group should not play.',
 'Select another Scene and build a variation. During playback the Perform Grid determines when a requested Scene change takes effect.',
 either('Open SCENE, hold SHIFT and use the SONG action. PROJECT is the neighbouring utility action.','Hold NAVIGATE and use SONG. Release NAVIGATE after the Song destination is highlighted.'),
 'Select a Scene before opening Song. INSERT (F1 / display button 1) inserts that Scene at the selected Song position. Turn the selection encoder to move through entries. PLAY (F2 / button 2) toggles Song playback; DELETE (F3 / button 3) removes an entry after confirmation.'],
 notes=[('Scene length','An automatic Scene length follows its active Patterns; an explicit Scene length can override it. Patterns can have different lengths and loop within a longer Scene.'),
 ('Make a variation independent','Duplicating a Scene does not necessarily make its Patterns independent. Use the unique/copy workflow when the variation must have its own editable Patterns.'),
 ('Master automation','Pattern automation lives with the Group Pattern. Song master automation is handled separately from those per-Pattern lanes.')])

chapter('Automation, macros and MIDI Learn',['MACRO','MACRO ASSIGN'],
 'Automation stores parameter movement against musical time. Macros expose useful controls together. MIDI Learn maps an external controller to the parameter you have touched.',
 steps=[either('Play the Pattern and use the AUTO-writing gesture shown by the current parameter view. On Mikro, hold SHIFT while changing supported parameters to write their movement.','Play the Pattern, hold AUTO WR. and turn a parameter encoder to write movement. SHIFT + AUTO WR. toggles a locked write state; press AUTO WR. again to leave it.'),
 'Release write mode and listen to the next loop. Parameter playback is transient: the saved base value remains distinct from the automated value.',
 'Use Macro Assign to select a target parameter, then expose it in the Macro page. Check the Sound/Group/Master scope before assigning.',
 'For MIDI Learn, touch the target parameter, open MIDI LEARN and send the external control message. Test the mapping with automation writing off first.'],
 notes=[('Clear the intended lane','SHIFT + pad 10 (CLR AUTO) clears automation according to the current target/selection. It does not delete the sample or the Pattern notes. Save before clearing automation you may need again.'),
 ('Scope and persistence','Sampler, routing, value and compatible plug-in parameters have automation targets. MIDI mappings and plug-in references are stored with the project; moving/removing a plug-in changes the corresponding targets.')])

chapter('MIDI ports, clock and Bluetooth',['MIDI IN','BLUETOOTH MIDI'],
 'Use Settings > MIDI for input, output, channel, clock, offset and learning. Available USB MIDI and controller DIN endpoints appear when their devices are connected.',
 steps=['Select MIDI INPUT for incoming notes and controllers, then MIDI OUTPUT for the external destination. Set the Sound output channel for the receiving instrument.',
 'Set CLOCK to OFF, IN or OUT. IN follows an external clock; OUT sends clock. Use CLOCK OFFSET to compensate the receiving setup after testing against a metronome.',
 'Open BLUETOOTH MIDI. Enable it with ON/OFF. On Mikro, F2 scans, SHIFT + F2 opens pairing and ENTER toggles connection for the selected device. On MK2, use PAIR, SCAN, CONNECT and DISCONN on their labelled display buttons.',
 'For an iPad, use a Bluetooth-MIDI-capable app to connect. For a keyboard, put the keyboard in its Bluetooth-MIDI pairing mode, then scan/connect from Machinista.'],
 notes=[('Bluetooth MIDI is not Bluetooth audio','This connection carries note/control/clock messages where supported. It is not an audio link to the iPad and does not make the Pi USB-C power connector a universal audio/MIDI peripheral port.'),
 ('Availability','A device can be visible in the port list without a complete end-to-end cable/app test. If no notes arrive, check selected port, channel, pairing and the receiving app rather than only the device name.')])

chapter('Project names, presets and portable saves',['PROJECT','PROJECT NAME'],
 'PROJECT provides SAVE, LOAD and MANAGE. Manage creates named projects, renames/deletes saved slots, collects samples and saves/loads Sound or Group presets.',
 steps=['Open PROJECT from System settings or the shifted Scene actions. Choose MANAGE, then NEW PROJECT. The new name starts empty.',
 'Turn the name encoder to choose a character and use navigation arrows to move the cursor. RANDOM suggests a name. SHIFT changes CANCEL to CLEAR; OK commits a valid name.',
 'Use RENAME to change a display name or SAVE AS to create an independent saved slot. DELETE asks for confirmation. Deleting a saved slot leaves the current working copy available as UNTITLED.',
 'Use SAVE SOUND/SAVE GROUP for reusable presets. Use COLLECT SAMPLES to copy referenced sample assets into a portable project location before moving it.'],

 ('Save shortcut',either('Use PROJECT > SAVE. The Project workspace is also available through System settings.','SHIFT + ALL saves the current project. Plain ALL is selection, not save.')),
 ('RAM and storage','Samples are loaded into RAM for playback; this is not a disk-streaming sampler. SAMPLE RAM can inspect usage and free unused sample memory while stopped.')])

chapter('Relink missing files and export',['MISSING SAMPLES','EXPORT'],
 'A project can reference unavailable external audio. Relink finds replacements. Export produces audio or MIDI files for use outside the groovebox without recording the physical outputs in real time.',
 steps=['If a project reports missing samples, open MANAGE > RELINK SAMPLES. Review the missing entry and search results, or browse to the exact replacement. Do not choose a similarly named but unrelated sample.',
 'For audio export choose MANAGE > EXPORT AUDIO. Set RANGE to PATTERN, SCENE or SONG and SOURCE to MIX, SOUND, GROUP or a stem set.',
 'Set sample rate, format/depth, tail length, normalization, loop optimization and destination. Confirm enough free space on SD/USB, then start the render.',
 'For notes choose EXPORT MIDI. After export, inspect the completion screen for the destination and file. Test the file in the receiving application.'],
 notes=[('Range matters','PATTERN export uses the selected Group Pattern. SCENE includes its active clips; SONG follows the Song list. A Song export requires a nonempty arrangement.'),
 ('Tails and loops','A tail preserves effect decay after the musical end. Loop optimization and long tails serve different goals. Choose settings according to whether the result is a repeating loop or a finished track.'),
 ('Export boundaries','The offline renderer uses the project engine and compatible plug-ins. External hardware audio is not recreated by exporting MIDI notes or an internal audio mix.')])

 ('CPU figures','The CPU percentage is overall use across cores, not a single core reading. Plug-ins, voices, sample rate and buffer size all affect the available headroom. A low idle value does not guarantee a heavy set will run without overruns.')])

chapter('WebUI, Wi-Fi and sample transfer',[],
 'The WebUI manages library files and shows system information. It also connects the Pi to a router. You can use it from a browser on a computer, tablet or phone.',
 steps=['When no saved router is connected, join Machinista-XXXX. XXXX is the last four hexadecimal characters of the permanent Wi-Fi MAC address. The hotspot password is machinista.',

SCREEN_HELP={
 'PAD':'Select Master, Group or Sound before editing level. This is the main control view, not the pad-mode configuration page.',
 'CHANNEL':'Output pages cover Audio, Aux 1 and Aux 2; Sound also has MIDI. Select the destination before changing its level.',
 'INPUT':'Choose a channel source, gain and monitor behaviour. Input belongs to Sound/Group scope; Master has no input module.',
 'GROOVE':'Adjust the amount and timing of groove for the selected scope. This is separate from destructive event quantization.',
 'MACRO':'Choose a macro, assign a compatible target or clear its assignment. The selected scope determines which macro set is edited.',
 'MACRO ASSIGN':'Select a compatible parameter target and APPLY. An empty list means no assignable target is currently available.',
 'SAMPLER':'Navigate parameter pages, then fields. Envelope type changes which controls are present. Play the Sound while adjusting.',
 'PLUGIN':'Parameters belong to the selected chain slot. SHIFT + BROWSE opens slot replacement/removal even when a plug-in is loaded.',
 'PLUGIN SLOTS':'Select a chain slot before copying, moving, bypassing or removing it. Instrument slots must remain first.',
 'PARAM NAV':'Preview the module and its subpage while NAV is held. Release NAV to enter that destination.',
 'BROWSE':'Turn to select a folder or WAV. Open folders, BACK goes up; PREHEAR auditions. Pads choose the receiving Sound.',
 'PLUGIN BROWSE':'Choose a compatible LV2 effect/instrument or the remove entry. Loading an occupied slot replaces that slot.',
 'PLUGIN MOVE':'Select the destination slot and confirm MOVE. Cancel returns without reordering the chain.',
 'PLUGIN SC':'Select a sidechain source only for a plug-in that exposes sidechain input. Feedback cycles are rejected.',
 'SAMPLING':'Select source, input and Detect/Sync options. START arms capture; STOP finishes it; CANCEL abandons the take.',
 'SAMPLING NAV':'Preview Record, Edit, Slice or Zone before releasing NAV. The subpage indicator follows the selected destination.',
 'SAMPLE EDIT':'START/END set playback or selection boundaries. Choose a process, check the range and confirm APPLY.',
 'CHOP':'Choose Split/Grid/Detect/Manual, audition cuts and use EDIT for boundaries. APPL.TO selects a destination.',
 'ZONE':'Choose the zone before changing its playback range, loop, tuning, envelope or key/velocity map.',
 'STRETCH':'Adjust stretch length and pitch, audition, then APPLY or cancel. This is a preview state until committed.',
 'SLICE TARGET':'Select Group and first Sound/all Sounds. SINGLE assigns only the selected slice. Check occupied destinations before APPLY.',
 'SAMPLE DELETE':'Choose REMOVE FROM PAD or DELETE FILE, then confirm. Assignment removal and physical file deletion are different operations.',
 'PAD CONFIG':'Choose Pad, Keyboard or 16 VEL. Fixed velocity affects performance; it is separate from zone gain or normalization.',
 'NOTE REPEAT':'Select rate and division, then hold pads. With playback running, repeat follows the musical grid.',
 'ARP':'Held keyboard notes feed the arpeggiator. Gate, direction, octave range and Hold change its performance behaviour.',
 'GROUP':'Select the Group in the current bank. Patterns and Sound focus follow that Group; Group output/mute can silence its whole kit.',
 'SELECT':'Focus quietly or choose multiple targets. Event selection and Sound selection are separate scopes.',
 'DUPLICATE':'Choose source and destination in the active object scope. The events option determines whether related musical data is copied.',
 'MUTE':'Sound pads toggle mute. Inspect Group state as well; muted audio is cut immediately.',
 'SOLO':'A solo state can silence otherwise unmuted channels. Use the displayed reset actions when troubleshooting silence.',
 'STEP':'Pads toggle steps for the selected Sound/note. Bank and Follow change the visible time window, not the Pattern length.',
 'PATTERN':'Pads select Patterns. LENGTH, DOUBLE and DUPLICATE affect the current Group Pattern. ENTER/EDITOR opens the event grid.',
 'PATTERN GRID':'Navigate time and row/pitch, mark a selection and open EDIT. Follow pauses when you move the edit cursor.',
 'GRID EDIT':'Change position, pitch, velocity, probability or duration for the active target set. DELETE asks for confirmation.',
 'EVENT':'Inspect the focused event in the compact event view. Previous/next moves the cursor; delete requires confirmation.',
 'OPTIONS':'Grid, quantize strength and swing have different purposes. Choose the intended tab before changing a value.',
 'RECORD SETTINGS':'Set metronome level, count-in length and recording quantize. SHIFT + GRID opens this workspace.',
 'RECORD PREPARE':'Hold REC for one second to prepare length/grid. Release REC to return to the prior view ready to record.',
 'MIDI TRACK':'Set the Sound note source, MIDI destination/channel and note behaviour for external instruments.',
 'VIEW NAV':'Adjust view zoom/scroll or choose the labelled destination. This is view navigation, not individual note editing.',
 'SCENE':'Pads recall Scenes. Each Scene holds Group Pattern references; change timing follows Perform Grid.',
 'SONG':'INSERT adds the selected Scene, PLAY toggles arrangement playback and DELETE removes the chosen entry after confirmation.',
 'SONG AUTO':'Choose a Song master-automation lane. Toggle it or remove it without deleting its Scene reference.',
 'MIXER':'Choose scope, then Level/Pan/Route. The meters show audio activity, not whether a Pattern contains notes.',
 'PROJECT':'SAVE stores the current project; LOAD chooses a saved slot; MANAGE exposes names, presets, relink and export.',
 'PROJECT LOAD':'Select a saved project and confirm loading. Shift actions rename/delete the selected slot; NEW begins name entry.',
 'PROJECT MANAGE':'Select an operation and OPEN. New, Rename and Save As have different effects on saved slots.',
 'PROJECT NAME':'Arrows move the cursor; the encoder changes a character. RANDOM suggests a name, SHIFT + CANCEL clears, OK commits.',
 'PRESET LOAD':'Choose a compatible Sound/Group preset and load it into the current target. Keep the target scope in mind.',
 'MISSING SAMPLES':'Search or browse for unavailable referenced audio. Scan again after connecting the missing USB source.',
 'RELINK RESULTS':'Review candidates before selecting a replacement. Browse manually when no exact match is found.',
 'RELINK BROWSE':'Navigate to the intended replacement WAV. Similar filenames are not proof that the audio is the same.',
 'SAMPLE RAM':'REFRESH queries loaded sample memory. PURGE frees unused sample data while playback/recording is stopped.',
 'EXPORT':'Choose range, source, format/depth and destination. Rendering is isolated from the live audio device.',
 'EXPORT DONE':'Read the output location and filename. BACK returns; NEW sets up another export.',
 'CONFIRM':'Read the full prompt before confirming. YES executes the operation; CANCEL keeps the current content.',
 'SETTINGS':'Choose Audio, MIDI or System, select the row and ENTER. Settings persist across restarts.',
 'SYSTEM':'The first page shows the Machinista logo/version. On Mikro, continue to CPU/RAM, then storage. On MK2 CPU/RAM is already on the right; following pages show storage.',
 'BLUETOOTH MIDI':'Enable, pair/scan and connect a MIDI device. This provides MIDI, not a Bluetooth audio stream.',
